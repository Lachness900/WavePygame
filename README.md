# WavePygame
A project in year 11 in which you move your dot to avoid red dots.
I worked on it for two or three weekends at the start of the year.
I decided to learn python and thought this was the perfect way to do it.
Overall, I quite proud of how it turned out.

Controls
Move with arrow keys
Activate magic system with shift, move around the bottem left minimap with arrow keys to select a spell and space to fire.
Have fun experimenting with the magic :)

Be careful, you cannot move while preparing a spell and enemies get faster over time

It can be considered a win if you get to 100s or 500 kills(Though a winsreen doesn't exist)
