A weekend project in year 11 in which you move your dot to avoid red dots.
I decided to learn python and thought this was the perfect way to do it.

Controls
Move with arrow keys
Activate magic system with shift, move around the bottem left minimap with arrow keys to select a spell and space to fire.
Have fun experimenting with the magic.

Be careful, you cannot move while preparing a spell and enemies get faster over time

It can be considered a win if you get to 100s or 500 kills(Though a winsreen doesn't exist)
